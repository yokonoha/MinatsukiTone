## About the name of this Web app  
The word "Minatsuki" is derived from the Japanese word "Minazuki" (水無月), which is the traditional name for June in the Japanese lunar calendar.  
The kanji characters break down as:  
水 (Mi): Water  
無 (Na): 's / Of (This character literally means "nothing" or "without," but in this specific context, it is interpreted as a particle connecting "Water" and "Month" or related to the season.)  
月 (Tsuki): Month/Moon→ Reflected in the use of Shikkoku (漆黒), or "Jet Black," which represents the deep color of a moonlit night sky.  
These two core colors — Water Blue and Jet Black—define the unique visual identity of the MinatsukiTone user interface.
