##  About the Concept and Name: MinatsukiTone  

The name **"MinatsukiTone"** is a variation on the Japanese word **"Minazuki" (水無月)**, which traditionally refers to **June**, the sixth month of the Japanese lunar calendar.  

The visual concept is derived directly from the kanji that form the word:  

* **水 (Mizu)**: **Water**  
* **無 (Na)**: A connecting particle (literally "without" or "nothing")  
* **月 (Tsuki)**: **Month/Moon**

### Relationship to the App's UI Colors  

These kanji are the foundation of our design's color palette:  

1.  **Water (水):** This character is represented by **Mizuiro (水色), or "Water Blue,"** which serves as the bright, primary theme color for the UI.
2.  **Moon (月):** This connection inspires the use of a **deep, subdued black** (or "Night Shade"). This hue evokes the **night sky gently illuminated by the moonlight**, providing necessary depth and a beautiful contrast to the Water Blue.  

These two core colors—Water Blue and Night Shade Black—define the unique visual identity of the MinatsukiTone user interface.
